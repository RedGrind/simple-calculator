# Simple-Calculator
### Four Function Calculator

The simple calculator is basically designed to do what any other four-function calculator app is supposed to. 

#### Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide 

In the future, I hope to be able to create graphing calculators as well as a website, from reactjs, that helps you find valuable free resources to code, or to learn more in general

I would like to say, thank you for visiting this page and also thank you for reading this file. 

### Over the summer a lot of changes are coming to this project, hopefully I'll have it done before the end of June

##### 5/29/2022: Got the look of the calculator to be finished, subject to change in the future.
